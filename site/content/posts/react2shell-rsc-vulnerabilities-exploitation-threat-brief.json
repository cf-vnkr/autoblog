For the full details and context, please read the original post.\n\n**Key Technical Details and Main Announcements**\n\nOn December 3, 2025, a critical Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability, CVE-2025-55182 (known as React2Shell), was disclosed in React Server Components (RSC). The vulnerability affects servers using the RSC Flight protocol and has a CVSS score of 10.0. It is caused by an unsafe deserialization flaw in the RSC Flight data-handling logic, allowing attackers to inject logic that the server interprets in a privileged context. Cloudflare has deployed new rules across its network to mitigate this vulnerability, including blocking rules in both the Cloudflare Free Managed Ruleset and the standard Cloudflare Managed Ruleset.\n\n**Practical Implications for Developers**\n\nDevelopers using React Server Components should take immediate action to ensure their applications are not vulnerable to this exploit. This includes updating to the latest version of React Server Components and configuring Cloudflare's default security settings to block RCE attempts. Additionally, developers should implement proper validation and sanitization of user input to prevent similar deserialization flaws in the future.\n\n**Important Facts and Figures**\n\n* CVE-2025-55182 has a CVSS score of 10.0, indicating maximum severity.\n* The vulnerability affects servers using the RSC Flight protocol.\n* Cloudflare has deployed new rules to mitigate this vulnerability, including blocking rules in both the Cloudflare Free Managed Ruleset and the standard Cloudflare Managed Ruleset.\n* The vulnerability was disclosed on December 3, 2025, and exploitation attempts were observed within hours.",
