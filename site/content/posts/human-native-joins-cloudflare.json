For the full details and context, please read the original post.\n\n**Cloudflare Acquires Human Native to Enhance AI Data Marketplace**\n\nCloudflare has acquired Human Native, a UK-based AI data marketplace specializing in transforming multimedia content into searchable and useful data. Human Native's technology helps publishers and developers turn messy, unstructured content into something that can be understood, licensed, and valued. This acquisition marks a significant step towards creating a more transparent and respectful economic model for the Internet, where content creators are fairly compensated for their work.\n\n**Key Technical Details and Implications for Developers**\n\nThe acquisition brings Cloudflare's expertise in AI Crawl Control and Pay Per Crawl, which enable content owners to decide how and when their content is accessed by AI systems. This is particularly relevant in the context of generative AI, where high-quality data is essential for building better AI models. With Human Native's technology, developers can now access high-quality, licensed data that is structured and transparent, reducing the complexity and costs associated with crawling and processing unstructured data.\n\n**New Tools and Features for AI Developers**\n\nThe integration of Human Native's technology with Cloudflare's existing tools, such as AI Search and AI Crawl Control, will enable developers to create better AI models that are built on high-quality, licensed data. Additionally, Cloudflare's AI Index, a powerful new way for developers to access content at scale, will be further enhanced with the acquisition. This will provide developers with a more efficient and cost-effective way to access content, reducing the need for repeated crawling and processing of unstructured data.\n\n**Timeline and Future Developments**\n\nThe acquisition is a significant step towards creating a more sustainable economic model for the Internet, where content creators are fairly compensated for their work. Cloudflare's investment in the x402 Foundation, in partnership with Coinbase, will further enable machine-to-machine transactions and create new business models for content creators. As the Internet continues to evolve, Cloudflare's acquisition of Human Native will play a crucial role in shaping the future of AI data marketplace and ensuring that content creators are fairly compensated for their work.",
