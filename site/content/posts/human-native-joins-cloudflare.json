For the full details and context, please read the original post.\n\n**Cloudflare Acquires Human Native to Enhance AI Data Marketplace**\n\nCloudflare has acquired Human Native, a UK-based AI data marketplace specializing in transforming multimedia content into searchable and useful data. Human Native's technology helps publishers and developers turn messy, unstructured content into something that can be understood, licensed, and valued. This acquisition will accelerate Cloudflare's work in helping customers transform their content to be easily accessed and understood by AI bots and agents.\n\n**Key Technical Details and Implications for Developers**\n\nThe acquisition will enable Cloudflare to provide better AI data solutions for developers, including:\n\n1. **AI Index**: A powerful new way for foundation model companies and agents to access content at scale, using a pub/sub model that reduces crawling complexity and expenses.\n2. **AI Crawl Control**: A tool that allows content owners to decide how and when their content is accessed by AI systems, with options for direct compensation.\n3. **Pay Per Crawl**: A tool that enables content owners to receive compensation for each crawl of their content.\n\nThese solutions will help developers build better AI models by providing access to high-quality, licensed data, which can lead to improved technical performance and more accurate results.\n\n**Timeline and Future Developments**\n\nCloudflare is investing heavily in creating the foundations for new business models, starting with the x402 Foundation, in partnership with Coinbase. This foundation will enable machine-to-machine transactions and further accelerate the development of AI data solutions.",
