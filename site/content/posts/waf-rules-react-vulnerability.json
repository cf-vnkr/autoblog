For the full details and context, please read the original post.\n\n**Cloudflare WAF Protection Against React Vulnerability**\n\nCloudflare has deployed a new protection to address a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in React Server Components (RSC), with all Cloudflare customers automatically protected. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2025-55182 (CVSS 10.0), affects React versions 19.0, 19.1, and 19.2, as well as Next.js versions 15 through 16. Cloudflare Workers are inherently immune to this exploit, and React-based applications and frameworks deployed on Workers are not affected.\n\n**Key Technical Details and Recommendations**\n\nCloudflare has deployed new rules across its network, with the default action set to Block, to prevent the RCE vulnerability. These rules are included in both the Cloudflare Free Managed Ruleset and the standard Cloudflare Managed Ruleset. Customers on Professional, Business, or Enterprise plans should ensure that Managed Rules are enabled, while customers on a Free plan have these rules enabled by default. It is strongly recommended that customers update their systems to the most recent version of React (19.2.1) and the latest versions of Next.js (16.0.7, 15.5.7, 15.4.8).\n\n**Practical Implications for Developers**\n\nDevelopers should take immediate action to update their systems to the latest version of React and Next.js to prevent potential exploitation of the RCE vulnerability. Additionally, customers should ensure that Managed Rules are enabled on their Cloudflare account to take advantage of the new protections. Cloudflare's security team will continue to monitor for potential attack variations and update protections as necessary to secure all traffic proxied via Cloudflare.",
